## Structures

  ### Strut
  * Structural component that resists compression

## Fasteners


### SHCS



* Socket head cap screw


### Micro D Jackpost



* The fastener on the female side of the connector


### Micro D Jackscrew



* The screw that goes into the jackpost when mating connectors


### Types of threadlockers



* Inert: No chemical reaction takes place. The prevailing torque keeps it in place
    * Can also be adjusted after the fact
* Reactive: Chemical reaction takes place during installation
    * Sometimes the chemical reaction creates an


### Dial indicator torque wrench



* A type of torque wrench that has a dial on main pointer to display the amount of torque applied when turning


## Fatigue


### Fatigue



* One of the most common failure mechanisms in engineering structures
* It has a statistical nature


### S-N Curve



* A way to describe the fatigue properties of materials: describes the relation between cyclic stress amplitude and the number of cycles to a failure
* Horizontal axis: Number of cycles to failure on a log scale (N)
* Vertical axis (either linear or log): The stress amplitude - the maximum stress of a cycle (S<sub>a</sub>)
* They’re derived empirically
* Aka. the fatigue limit, fatigue curve, Wöhler curve
* Example curve:

### Infinite life



* Sometimes a test is stopped after an incredibly large (i.e. N > 10<sup>6</sup>), and this is interpreted as infinite life of the material
* More common for metals than plastics
* Denoted as S<sub>f</sub>


### Notch



* A deliberately induced v-shape, u-shape, or circle which causes a stress concentration
* This allows for fatigue cracks to start and grow more easily
* Notched specimens will break via fatigue before unnotched specimens. Thus it’s important to make this distinction when running tests
    * This is because stress concentration at the notch causes a stress gradient


### K<sub>t</sub>



* If a fatigue curve specimen is notched or not. 
* K<sub>t</sub> = 1 means unnotched
* K<sub>t</sub> > 1 = notched
