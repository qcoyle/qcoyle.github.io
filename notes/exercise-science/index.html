<h2 id="general-terminology">General Terminology</h2>


<h3 id="endurance">Endurance</h3>




* The maximum sustainable work rate an athlete can keep for the duration of an event before fatigue starts to slow the work rate

<h3 id="fatigue-in-ultrarunning">Fatigue in Ultrarunning</h3>




* Reduced stride length and/or slower stride rate

<h3 id="human-evolutionary-advantages">Human evolutionary advantages</h3>




* Can store huge quantities of fat. Fat = caloric fuel tank for excess calories consumed during plentiful times
    * Go multiple days between meals as a result
* Recover muscle glycogen quickly: hours of rest instead of days
    * Good for hunting. Run prey to exhaustion

<h2 id="molecular-energy-sources">Molecular Energy Sources</h2>


<h3 id="fat">Fat</h3>




* Contains lots of bonds with usable energy
* Even a lean endurance athlete can carry 100,000 calories in accessible fat

<h3 id="carbohydrates">Carbohydrates</h3>




* Simpler molecules with less energy in their bonds
* We can only store about 2,000 calories of carbs at a time
* Contain about half the calories per gram as fat

<h3 id="proteins">Proteins</h3>




* Used primarily as a structural component of bio molecules
* Build/repair muscle tissue, used to create antibodies and white blood cells (immune health), creates hormones/enzymes/red blood cells, and contributes to structure of organs/bones/skin/hair
* Used for fuel only as a last resort

<h3 id="atp">ATP</h3>




* Adenosine Triphosphate: a short-term energy-storage molecule used by every cell in the body
* The energy released when ATP bonds are broken is what powers all life; as such ATP is used to power muscular contractions
* Ultimately fats and carbs provide energy to assemble ATP
* Endurance athletes go through a high turnover of ATP

<h3 id="fat-adaption">Fat adaption</h3>




* Being able to make more use of fat energy stores during workouts
* It’s highly efficient because of how many calories we carry in fat. The analogy is you want to be sipping from your glycogen stores while guzzling from your fat stores

<h3 id="2-ways-to-increase-fat-adaption">2 ways to increase fat adaption</h3>




* Do some long aerobic building workouts in a fasted state, I.e. training in the morning before consuming any calories
* Consume a diet with fewer carb calories and more fat. Note if you train more than 12 hrs per week this is less effective because the training volume is providing ample fat adaption

<h3 id="2-benefits-of-fat-adaption">2 benefits of fat adaption</h3>




* Higher outputs for more time before you bonk
* (Much bigger benefit) reduced lactate production and as such lower perceived exertion. You will perform better.

<h2 id="performance-tripod">Performance Tripod</h2>


Consists of the following 3 components:

<h3 id="movement-economy">Movement Economy</h3>




* How much energy it costs you to move your body a certain distance
* Consists of a mechanical (technique) component and a metabolic component

<h3 id="lactate-threshold">Lactate Threshold</h3>




* Maximum work rate you can sustain for a long duration - i.e. pace you can sustain for 30-60 minutes
* The pace at LT is the best way to predict endurance performance

<h3 id="vo2-max">VO<sub>2 </sub>Max</h3>




* Maximum volume of oxygen you can take up and use during exercise: the upper limit of your aerobic power
* It can’t be sustained for long
* Units: 

<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


* Dependent on:
    1. Heart’s output
    2. Oxygen utilization of muscles
* Values for untrained men/women: 35-40 mL/kg/min and 25-30 mL/kg/min
* Values for highly trained men/women: 90-95 mL/kg/min and 75-80 mL/kg/min
* Fun fact: top racehorses 180 mL/kg/min, hummingbird 600 mL/kg/min, honey bee 6,000 mL/kg/min
* Note: a lot of it is genetic and it’s also the least correlated to ability

<h3 id="vo2-max-misunderstandings">VO<sub>2 </sub>Max misunderstandings</h3>




* It’s not a measure of endurance, rather it’s more analogous to maximum strength
* Elite athletes often increase performance significantly without increasing VO<sub>2 </sub>Max - by improving the two other areas of the endurance tripod
* Note: a lot of these misunderstandings are because it’s hard to find highly trained athletes to forgo their original trainings for studies; as such they’re often done on untrained athletes and VO2 max responds very well to first wave high intensity training in untrained athletes

<h2 id="metabolic-terminology">Metabolic Terminology</h2>


<h3 id="metabolism">Metabolism</h3>




* Biochemical process of breaking down molecular bonds from fats/sugars to provide the energy needed to create ATP

<h3 id="mitochondria">Mitochondria</h3>




* Small organelles in every cell (except for blood cells): they are factories that produce ATP with the help of oxygen

<h3 id="two-metabolic-pathways">Two metabolic pathways</h3>




* There are two ways ATP is produced:
    * Aerobic Metabolism
    * Anaerobic Glycolysis
* Note: each gives a different quantity of ATP per unit fuel consumed
* Note: each has a maximum capacity; training can increase that maximum

<h3 id="aerobic-metabolism">Aerobic metabolism</h3>




* Uses pyruvate (leftover from anaerobic process) and fat to make additional ATP
* Produces 17x more ATP than the anaerobic path but is a much slower and more complex process
* Can also use protein but protein contributes much less

<h3 id="anaerobic-metabolism-aka-glycolysis">Anaerobic metabolism (aka glycolysis)</h3>




* The way we get fueled by carbohydrates
* Used when ATP demands exceed what aerobic metabolism can provide
* A 10-step process that breaks apart glycogen; does not require oxygen
* The liver converts sugars into glucose and then that glucose is either:
    * Used immediately
    * Stored in the muscles/liver as glycogen for later use
* Results in the creation of a pyruvate molecule with two ATP’s on it; the ATP molecules are readily available as energy

<h3 id="pyruvate">Pyruvate</h3>




* The end product of glycolysis (anaerobic metabolism) - it goes down one of two paths:
    1. Gets transported into the mitochondria to help produce a lot more ATP via aerobic metabolism → GOOD
    2. Can sit outside the mitochondria and produce lactic acid → BAD

<h3 id="lactic-acid">Lactic acid</h3>




* Molecule that gets formed from pyruvate and then immediately dissociates into a lactate molecule + a hydrogen Ion
* The hydrogen Ion upsets the acid/base balance in the cell, causing a temporary reduction of glycolytic ATP production → fatigue

<h3 id="aerobic-vs-anaerobic-capacity">Aerobic vs. anaerobic capacity</h3>




* This determines the path the pyruvate molecule takes
* When aerobic, the athlete’s pyruvate production is small enough that most/all of it can be taken into the aerobic pathway because there’s enough mitochondrial capacity to do so. Minimal lactic acid gets created as a result
* When anaerobic, the athlete does not have enough aerobic capacity to move all the pyruvate (made during glycolysis) into the mitochondria → lactic acid builds up

<h3 id="endurance-from-a-metabolic-standpoint">Endurance (from a metabolic standpoint)</h3>




* The ability to sustain rapid ATP production for long durations
* The end goal of endurance is to encourage that pyruvate molecule to go into the mitochondria and undergo aerobic metabolism

<h3 id="aerobic-threshold-aet">Aerobic threshold (AeT)</h3>




* Aerobic threshold: intensity of work at which lactate rises 1mMol/L above baseline levels
* Usually determined by a lab test
* Typically the work intensity at which you can breathe through your nose or carry on a conversation - can be done for hours at a time
* Is highly trainable
* Is the single most important measure of a person’s aerobic performancep

<h3 id="lactate-threshold-lt">Lactate threshold (LT)</h3>




* Intensity of work at which lactate production exceeds its rate of removal into the mitochondria
* Exercise can only be sustained for a few minutes before fatigue causes you to slow down
* Once you hit the LT you are on borrowed time
* Is highly trainable

<h3 id="slow-twitch-vs-fast-twitch-muscles">Slow twitch vs. fast twitch muscles</h3>




* Slow twitch: Higher concentration of mitochondria in them, which makes them more fatigue resistant
* Fast twitch: fibers that contract with more force and are used when extra force is needed
    * They get fatigued quicker because they don’t have as many mitochondria
    * They require primarily on glycolysis, which produces a lot more pyruvate

<h2 id="increasing-the-lactate-threshold">Increasing the Lactate Threshold</h2>


<h3 id="two-ways-to-raise-the-lactate-threshold">Two ways to raise the Lactate Threshold</h3>




1. Reduce production of pyruvate and lactate in the first place
2. Increase the rate of removal of pyruvate/lactate from muscles
* Note: these require different forms of training that are sometimes mutually exclusive

<h3 id="reducing-lactate-production">Reducing Lactate Production</h3>




* Creating a larger reservoir of mitochondria in slow twitch muscles to take up and use excess lactate
* Involves improving muscle cells through lots of long duration low intensity work —> building an aerobic base
* This is because it depletes glycogen in slow twitch muscles

<h3 id="increasing-the-rate-of-lactate-removal">Increasing the rate of lactate removal</h3>




* Improves the lactate shuttle mechanism
* This should be focused on after reducing lactate production is maximized
* When we increase levels of lactate in muscles through some high intensity training, we increase the amount of transport proteins that “shuttle” lactate out
* However less of this high intensity training is needed than if often assumed

<h3 id="aerobic-deficiency-syndrome">Aerobic deficiency syndrome</h3>




* When high intensity training methods are overused which results in a low Aerobic Threshold (AeT) because their aerobic metabolism is undertrained

<h2 id="intensity-zones">Intensity Zones</h2>


<h3 id="intensity-zone-model">Intensity Zone Model</h3>




* Model that breaks down different levels of intensity into five zones
* Associates heart rate with intensity
* Anchored by the metabolic markers AeT (top of zone 2) and LT (top of zone 3)
* You may see other systems ranging from 3 zones to 7 zones

<h3 id="heart-rate-vs-intensity">Heart rate vs. intensity</h3>




* Viewed as the best marker of intensity we have, although it’s not perfect
* Where you are in recovery state affects this relationship

<h3 id="summary-of-the-zones">Summary of the Zones</h3>

<h3 id="recovery-zone">Recovery Zone</h3>




* Below zone 1, it plays a big role in speeding up recovery
* You should feel better immediately after doing one of these
* Good examples: light ride, swim, walk, yoga, foam roll

<h3 id="zone-1">Zone 1</h3>




* Aerobic base: sessions should be 30 min to several hours
* Should account for 50-70% of aerobic training for mountain athletes

<h3 id="zone-2">Zone 2</h3>




* Aerobic capacity: sessions should be 30-120 min
* Has the biggest impact in raising the AeT
* Still should mainly be used during the base phase of training, less of it after higher intensity workouts start
* Note: if you have a high AeT (in good shape) you should only spend 10-15% of weekly workouts in this zone. More training should be in zone 1, as to not risk overtraining

<h3 id="zone-3">Zone 3</h3>




* The endurance zone: it’s highest intensity aerobic training
* Glycolysis becomes the primary ATP source
* More fast twitch muscle fibers get recruited
* Lactate levels start to rise but are sustainable up to 1 hour in well trained athletes
* Note: zone 3 is seductive because you get a lot of benefits early on. It’s easy to think you can skip zone 1 and 2 training for zone 3. Don’t fall into this trap - overuse of this intensity can hurt performance. See the ten percent test below
* Should be no more than 10% of annual training volume

<h3 id="zone-4">Zone 4</h3>




* Power: maxing out aerobic and anaerobic
* Requires your muscles being able to handle it. If your legs are screaming at you but HR tops out at zone 3 levels, muscles need to be improved before you can get the full benefit of a zone 4 workout

<h3 id="zone-5">Zone 5</h3>




* Maximum anaerobic effort
* Can be maintained for 60-80 seconds
* Heart rate is not a good measure because there’s a lag in cardiac response
* Should be used by endurance athletes. Can usually start as 10 second uphill bursts and then be extended longer. Should always be done as intervaled so that muscle ATP stores can replenish (3 min is usually a good rest time). This can be tough for people who get antsy waiting during intervals
* There’s an injury risk here and it’s important to have a good strength base along with the above mentioned interval rest

<h3 id="ten-percent-test">Ten percent test</h3>




* Zone 3 training is most effective when AeT is within 10% (12-16 beats)  of LT (can be measured by either heart rate or pace)
* Note: if you’re higher than 10%, you can improve a lot of your aerobic base with Z1 and Z2 workouts and not do Z3 yet. If you’re lower than 10%, Z2 work can be substituted with Z3

<h3 id="zone-training-and-elite-athletes">Zone training and elite athletes</h3>




* A study by Stephen Seiler shows that elite endurance athletes tend to train 80% of the time below the AeT, 6-8% between the AeT and LT, and 12-14% above the LT.

<h2 id="recovery-tips">Recovery Tips</h2>


<h3 id="diet-post-workout">Diet post workout</h3>




* Eat 100-200 calories in the first 30 minutes after you exercise more than an hour. It should be in an easy to consume form
* These foods should be in a ratio of 3:1 or 4:1 carbs to protein
* This post workout window helps muscles replenish glycogen stores quicklyt
* If this window is missed, recovery can be delayed by up to 2 days

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>




* REM sleep (happens in bursts of 90 to 120 min) has a massive effect on HGH (Human Growth Hormone) production and therefore overall recovery + energy

<h3 id="self-massage">Self massage</h3>




* Use balls is the best way to do it outside of a massage therapist
* Can graduate to balls after starting with a foam roller
* The Roll Model by Jill Miller is a good guide on rolling massages
